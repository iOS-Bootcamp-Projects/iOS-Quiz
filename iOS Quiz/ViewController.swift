IBOutlet connects a proprety in our code to an object in a storyboard while an IBAction connects an event generated by an object in a storyboard to a method in our code."),

            ("What is the Controller in MVC responsible for?", "Controller objects facilitate the communication between the Model and the View since the Model and the View should never directly talk to each other (remember the Model knows nothing about the user interface).")
